# Flow state — CloudView re-audit

Goal: fix the defects confirmed by live beta testing, verified in a browser.
Done = each fix demonstrated against the running app, tsc clean, pushed.

## Tasks
- [x] BT-01 NFC origin mismatch locked guests out — redirect now stays on the
      request origin so the cookie it just set survives. Verified: entry on
      localhost:3005 (previously an unrecoverable loop) now reaches the portal.
- [x] BT-02 HotelSettings leaked into guest HTML — explicit select; all seven
      xendit* columns gone from every guest surface.
- [x] BT-03 Prisma Decimal crossed the client boundary — converted once in the
      loader. React warning gone; money math unchanged (260 + 26 + 31.20 = 317.20).
- [x] BT-04 three unlabelled checkout inputs — all 9 controls now named.
- [x] BT-05 delta badge announced -100% as "100%" — direction in the accessible
      name, sign made visible.
- [x] BT-06 media root defaulted to a Linux path on dev machines — falls back to
      public/uploads outside production; production path unchanged.
- [x] BT-07 dead Place Order button — validation now speaks.
- [x] BT-08 "All 5" over a list of 4 — grid says "4 more items".
- [ ] BT-09 redundant hotel/category rows in the dashboard menu query (~42 KB).
      DEFERRED: low value, and narrowing the select risks breaking consumers for
      a payload win that only shows on an admin page.
- [ ] BT-10 tag scanSecret stored in plaintext; verifyTagSecret hashes both
      sides so the hashing protects nothing against a database leak.
      DEFERRED: needs a migration plus a rotation of every live tag.

## Decisions
- Guest-facing severity beat admin-facing severity throughout; BT-09 is the only
  finding skipped on cost/benefit rather than risk.
- The launch handler's *denial* redirects still use the configured origin. They
  carry no cookie, so the mismatch is harmless there, and leaving them alone
  kept the change to the one path that was broken.
- Delta badge still shows an up arrow at exactly 0. The accessible name says
  "No change" and the text shows no sign, so this is cosmetic only.

## Not verified in-browser
- BT-05 was verified by rendering the real component source in isolation, not
  through the analytics page: the dashboard session expired mid-run and logging
  in would mean entering a password.
